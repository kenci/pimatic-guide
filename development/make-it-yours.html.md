### package.json

Your plugin is just a Node.js module. Every Node.js modules needs a `package.json` file with 
some meta information about the module. 

The plugin-template already included one, but you have to edit it so that it contains the information
about your plugin like name, author, version, ...

You can read about it in the [npm package.json documentation](https://npmjs.org/doc/json.html).
