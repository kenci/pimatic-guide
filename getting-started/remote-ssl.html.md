If you want to use pimatic over the internet you should always use a SSL-Connection (https) for security reasons.
You can configurate pimatic to run just the http- or https-Server or both. By default only the (insecure) http server is enabled.

### Preparation

To connect to your Raspberry Pi from the internet , you need first to set up two things:

1. A [Dynamic DNS](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamic_DNS) for your home internet ip. So it can be accessed independent of the assigned IP-Address from you internet service provider. Most routers have an option for this, so check the user manual of your router.
2. Configure your router to [forward the port](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Port_forwarding) of the https-server (default 443) to the local IP-Address of your  Raspberry Pi. Check again the user manual of your router.

### Creating a SSL-Certificate

To use the https-Server properly you need to create a self-signed certificate. This involves creating a certificate authority (CA) to sign it.
Luckily we have written a script to simplify this:

```
sudo apt-get install wget
cd pimatic-app
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pimatic/pimatic/master/install/ssl-setup
chmod +x ./ssl-setup
./ssl-setup
```

You have to give some information including your dynamic DNS address. At the end it creates 3 files:

* The public certificate `ca/pimatic-ssl/public/cert.pem`, that will be used for the SSL-Connection
* A private key `ca/pimatic-ssl/private/privkey.pem`, that should be kept secret and is used for the SSL-Connection
* A authority certificate `ca/certs/cacert.crt`, that should be imported to all your devices (smartphone, desktop, ...).

### Configuration

Edit or add the `https`-Confiuration options in the `settings`-Section of your `config.json`. It should look like this:

```
"httpsServer": {
  "enabled": true,
  "port": 443,
  "hostname": "",
  "keyFile": "ca/pimatic-ssl/private/privkey.pem",
  "certFile": "ca/pimatic-ssl/public/cert.pem",
  "rootCertFile": "ca/certs/cacert.crt"
},
```

The last step is to import the authority certificate to all your devices by going to: `http://your-ddns/root-ca-cert.crt` on each device and accepting the import. If you don't do this, you will get SSL-warnings when accesssing pimatic and experience issues with caching (see: [#282](https://github.com/pimatic/pimatic/issues/282)).
